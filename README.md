# Grid Co-ordinate Reference Calculations

This repo contains sample code for working with regular hexagon and triangle grids.

It's been written as clearly and compactly as possible, to serve as a tutorial and reference for how to work with these grids. 
There's many different co-ordinate systems for working with grids - this guide only covers the systems that are easiest to work with, and convert between.
