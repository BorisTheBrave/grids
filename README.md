# Grid Co-ordinate Reference Calculations

This repo contains sample code for working with regular hexagon and triangle grids.

It's been written as clearly and compactly as possible, to serve as a tutorial and reference for how to work with these grids. 
There's many different co-ordinate systems for working with grids - this guide only covers the systems that are easiest to work with, and convert between.

## Available Grids

## Usage

The code here focuses on keeping the methods as readable as possible. In real life usage, I'd recommend using classes to represent a cell and the grid as a whole.

The code uses a three-coordinate system for referring to hexes and triangles. This is simplest for working with in memory, but it's not a good format for storage. You can use methods like `hex_rect_index`/`hex_rect_deindex` to convert from co-ordinates to/from a single integer that addresses the cells starting at 0 and counting upwards without gaps, allowing you to store cell values efficiently in a 1d array or file.

Note that some important grid methods, like path finding, are not included. These methods are the same for any type of grid, you can find good references elsewhere.

## Ports

If you port this code to other languages, let me know and I'll keep a list here. You should document what date the porting was done as a simple versioning scheme.
